Their main target group is people who are aged above 60 and with special dietary needs. Even though there are many food services companies in the market, Starets is the monopoly in the elderâ€™s food business. Since its focus group is elderly, Starets wants to maintain their website as easily accessible and more secure from vulnerabilities. I have been approached with the above requirement from Starets foods. I have given a suggestion to use ECS with Terraform infrastructure using far gate serverless platform. As a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, extended my support to protect their website more Secure and reliable based on cloud DevSecOps Technology. Our technical recommendations are as follows in detail. 
Cloud Infrastructure dependencies:
AWS ECS with Far gate is a serverless computing platform that makes running containerized services on AWS easier than ever before. With Far gate, a user simply defines the compute resources such as CPU and memory that a service will need to run, and Far gate will manage where to run the container behind the scenes. There is no point where setting up an EC2 instance is required. Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool created by Hashicorp to make handling infrastructure more straightforward and manageable.
